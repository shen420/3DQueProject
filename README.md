# 3DQueProject
In this project, I used Spring-Boot and its Spring Web Dependency to help me implement a REST API. I used a @RestController to handle the HTTP request and @GetMapping to map the GET "/reverse" request to the reverse() method which extracts the input string with @PathVariable and prints out the reverse string. One challenge of this project is handling the exceptions when the URL is invalid such as "/error" instead of "/reverse" is entered into the URL or the <string> is empty. To handle such cases, I used an ErrorController which will print out an error message in such exception cases. For unit testing, I tested both the regular controller and ErrorController with Spring's MockMVC which is able to simulate a HTTP request without actually starting the server.
